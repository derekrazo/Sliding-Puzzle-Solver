Tasks:

1. Parser input and goal file into a data structure.

2. A subroutine that tries to connect them in parallel.

3. Equals method for board states

4. Tray class (Nodes which contain board states)
  -//contain every possible move

5. Graph of trays 

6. Output functions

7. Double Graph traversal algorithm (built in reversible algorithm)

8. isOK

9. Data structure which contains tray states already visited

10. Function that determines possible moves (tray) returns data structure with next moves. Refers to previous moves

11. Compares the progress of both graph traversals

12. Block class
	-isMoveable attribute
	-moveDirections
	-goal state

13. How to represent configuration such that it optimizes operations.

14. Scheduler


15. Configuration hash function

16. Tests for everything
